Apart from not getting detailed information about your test setup the main problem seems to be, that you use a message size of 64 byte. This is far away from the usual MTU of 1500 bytes and makes UDP highly inefficient: while TCP merges multiple sends into a single packet on the wire (except if TCP_NODELAY is set) to make efficient use of the link, each UDP message will result in a separate packet. In numbers: about 23 messages of size 64 byte will be combined into a single TCP packet of MTU size, while it will need 23 single packets for UDP for the same amount of data. Each of these packets means overhead with sending from the host, transmitting on the wire and receiving by the peer. And as seen in your case about 80% of the UDP packets get lost because your hardware is not fast enough to transmit and receive all these packets.
